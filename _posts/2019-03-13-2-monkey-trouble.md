In the historic second episode of *Dusty VCR*, we re-watch the 1994 marsupial classic, [*Monkey Trouble*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110557/), starring Thora Birch and Harvey Keitel.

The Dusty VCR team talks about how stressful action is in children's movies, top-notch monkey acting, and what type of trouble we would get into if we ourselves were monkeys.
