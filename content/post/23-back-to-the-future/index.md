[Buddha Joe](https://www.buddhajoecomedy.com) join us on the podcast to discuss his all-time favorite movie, 1985's [_Back to the Future_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/), starring Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Lea Thompson.

We talk about Joe's love of pranking, the universal joy of two-fingered skateboarding, and how _Back to the Future_ shaped Matt into the man he is today.
