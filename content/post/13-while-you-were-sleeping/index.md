Comedian and fan-favorite [Matt Woodland](https://www.instagram.com/matt.woodland/) makes his triumphant return to Dusty VCR to discuss his favorite genre: rom-coms.

We re-watch the 1995 classic [_While You Were Sleeping_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114924/) with Sandy B and Billy P. We talk about over-the-top romantic gestures, dating culture in the 1920s when Matt was growing up, and we reverse-engineer our parents' present motivations at Christmas.

Finally, we play a rousing and high-scoring edition of The Mom Game!
