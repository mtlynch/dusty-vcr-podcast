Chrissy P joins us on the pod to talk about one of her childhood favorites, the Disney classic [_The Little Mermaid_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097757/).

Chrissy tells us about Mr. Bear, the stuffed bear she's had since childhood and how people react to it. We also get into sexy mermaids and the fleeting moment before a first kiss.
