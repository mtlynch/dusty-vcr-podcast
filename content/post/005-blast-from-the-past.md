Laura Fattaruso, comedian and host of [*Lab Talk with Laura*](https://soundcloud.com/labtalkwithlaura), joins Dusty VCR to revisit the 1999 movie, [*Blast from the Past*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124298/), starring Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Christopher Walken, and Sissy Spacek.

We pinpoint the exact moment this movie transforms into *Clueless*, we explore the features of our own nuclear bunkers, and we debut the game, "Candid, Stranded, or Enchanted."
