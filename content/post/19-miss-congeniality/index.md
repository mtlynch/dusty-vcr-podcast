Fan favorite [Tricia D'Onofrio](https://instagram.com/keylimepie4) returns to the podcast to talk about the 2000 film [_Miss Congeniality_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212346/), starring Sandra Bullock, Michael Caine, and Benjamin Bratt.

We talk about 90s deepfake technology, romcom tropes, and how Tricia became one of the cool kids at circus camp.
