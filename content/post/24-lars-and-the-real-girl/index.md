Xena Dreyfuss makes their triumphant return to the podcast in honor of Rachel's birthday. We discuss Rachel's all-time favorite movie, [_Lars and the Real Girl_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0805564/), starring Ryan Gosling, Emily Mortimer, and Patricia Clarkson.

We talk about Xena's childhood rebellion, why Xena's mom made an exception to the no-violence, no-sex in movies rule so that the family could watch The Shining while Xena was six years old, and why we're all afraid to use someone's name the first time we meet them.
