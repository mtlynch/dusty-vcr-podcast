In a special Father's Day episode of *Dusty VCR*, we're joined by Bob Lynch, dad to many of the *Dusty VCR* hosts. And we're talking about one of his favorite movies: the 1992 comedy [*My Cousin Vinny*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104952/), starring Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei.

In this episode, we discuss miscommunication sagas, classic cars, and we play a trivia game to see how well our dad knows his children.
