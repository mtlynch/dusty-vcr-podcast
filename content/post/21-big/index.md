Comedian Vally D and Dusty VCR superstar and guest host Matt Woodland join us on the podcast to discuss the 1988 film [*Big*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094737/), starring Tom Hanks and Elizabeth Perkins.

We talk about gaining our parents' approval, our childhood relationships with walkie talkies, and we decide whether to go back to middle school for a do-over with our adult minds.
