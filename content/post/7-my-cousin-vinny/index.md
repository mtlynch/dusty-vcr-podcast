In a special Father's Day episode of _Dusty VCR_, we're joined by Bob Lynch, dad to many of the _Dusty VCR_ hosts. And we're talking about one of his favorite movies: the 1992 comedy [_My Cousin Vinny_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104952/), starring Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei.

In this episode, we discuss miscommunication sagas, classic cars, and we play a trivia game to see how well our dad knows his children.
