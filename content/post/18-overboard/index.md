Dusty VCR all-star [Matt Woodland](https://wanderjest.com/matt.woodland) returns to the podcast to discuss the 1987 film [*Overboard*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093693/), starring Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. And in a Dusty VCR first, we also watched [the 2018 reboot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1563742/) to compare how they updated this eighties classic for modern audiences.

We talk about homeschooling, childhood discipline, and the inexplicable need young boys have to tell their friends which women they find attractive.
