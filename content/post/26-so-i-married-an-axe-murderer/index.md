[Darren Sechrist](https://www.facebook.com/DarrenSechristComedian/) joins us on the pod to talk about the forgotten 1993 comedy, _So I Married An Axe Murderer_.

We try to figure out if Mike Myers was ever charming, we uncover a secret about Michael Richards getting canceled, and we temporarily become a podcast to discuss deer.
