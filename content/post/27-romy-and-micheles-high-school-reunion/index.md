[Emily Mame Ford](https://www.emilymame.com/) joins us to discuss one of the most nineties movies we've ever seen &mdash; the 1997 classic, _Romy and Michele's High School Reunion_.

We talk about the despair of The Sims, try to figure out if we were bullied in high school, compare notes about who was cool based on prom, and we decide whether to show up at our high school reunions by helicopter.
