Laura Fattaruso, comedian and host of [_Lab Talk with Laura_](https://soundcloud.com/labtalkwithlaura), joins Dusty VCR to revisit the 1999 movie, [_Blast from the Past_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124298/), starring Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Christopher Walken, and Sissy Spacek.

We pinpoint the exact moment this movie transforms into _Clueless_, we explore the features of our own nuclear bunkers, and we debut the game, "Candid, Stranded, or Enchanted."
