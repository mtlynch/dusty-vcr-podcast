Comedian and returning champion Penina Beede joins us to discuss the 1988 film, *Dirty Rotten Scoundrels*, starring Steve Martin, Michael Caine, and Glenne Headly. We talk about Pez conventions, find out why Jewish mothers slap their daughters, and we explore the dumbest lies we've ever told.

Penina tells us about her upcoming podcast, [*25 for 25*](https://peninabeede.squarespace.com/25for25), where she interviews 25 people about what their lives were like at age 25. The first episode is out March 1st.
