Who better to join us on this Mother's Day than the Dusty VCR mom herself, Sue Lynch!

<!--more-->

We discuss our mom's favorite movie, Notting Hill, starring Hugh Grant and Juila Roberts. We talk about our best celebrity sightings, Matt's brief time as a teen heartthrob, and Mom competes against herself in our most exciting edition of The Mom Game to date!
